      <p>Dear family members:</p>
      <p>
        The 2022 Brown-Hatter family reunion planning committee is very pleased
        to announce the details of our family reunion from June 30th to July
        3rd, 2022 in Cincinnati, Ohio. We have worked hard to put together a
        weekend of activities and entertainment that will allow us to share our
        family history and create new memories. Here is a great chance for us to
        have a good time enjoying family members, to rekindle friendships, and
        to enjoy the many sites that Cincinnati has to offer. We hope that the
        friendships made these four days in Cincinnati will continue to grow and
        bring us closer together as a family. We are doing everything to make
        this reunion and your visit here as memorable as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have limited the activities to one each day so everyone can have some
        free time to spend with whomever or wherever as they please. We have
        also planned one dinner each night where we can all get together in
        fellowship.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cincinnati, Ohio has many fun activities and offerings including:
        Aronoff museum, Cincinnati Arts Museum, Cincinnati Zoo, Newport
        Aquarium, Kings Island, Ark Encounter (45 minutes south of downtown
        Cincinnati), trolley rides, Skystar Ferris Wheel, and Major league
        baseball team (Cincinnati Reds).
      </p>

      <p>Please make copies of this form or forward registration packet by email to family members that we may have missed.</p>

      <p>We are looking forward to seeing everyone at the Brown-Hatter Reunion in 2022.</p>

      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p>Your Family Reunion Planning Committee.</p>
